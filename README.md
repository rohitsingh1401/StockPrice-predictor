Random stocks are chosen and a random date in the past is chosen. stock price starts trending from that date and continues for 365 days. While the stock price trends, the user competes against an AI in buying/selling stocks which is fun.
AI learns to predict the trend and the exact time of seling out / buying out the stock to come up with the most profit

PANDAS and SCI-KIT LEARN was used to develop a linear regression model to predict stock price. D3 and REACT were used to plot the data and update the leaderboard. Optimized for desktop and mobile.
